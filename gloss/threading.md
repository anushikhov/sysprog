# Threading  

There are various threading methods, and each method provides a different mechanism for handling the distribution of tasks to the threads. Some common threading methods include explicit or native threading (e.g. Win32, pthreads), threading abstraction(Intel Threading Building Blocks, OpenMP).  

Explicit threading methods do not have any means to automatically schedule a set of independent tasks to threads. When needed, such capability must be programmed into the application.
