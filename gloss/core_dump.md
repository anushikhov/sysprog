# Core dump  

A core/memory/crash/storage/system/ABEND dump consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally, as opposed to snapshot dump (or snap dump), after which the program is able to continue.
